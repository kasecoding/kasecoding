- 👋 Hi, I’m @kasecoding
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a fullstack developer so I can create both frontend and backend websites and possibly web applications that will one day help society and make it a better more accessible place.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning through coursera and attempting to earn a specialization in both front end and backend web development Im starting with front end first to create a clean website that I will eventually connect to a server
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a couple app and website ideas that I may need help producing. I have no real connections in this space however I am interested in getting help and obtaining my first job in the software field.
